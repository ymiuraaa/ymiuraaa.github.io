# Personal Website

A simple website where you can easily add content with markdown files. Then you build with Zola!
It's simple as that.

# Setup
## Installation
WSL/Ubuntu Linux:

You'll first need to install snap
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

Then you install Zola
```
sudo snap install zola --edge
```

MacOS:
you can simply install it through brew
```
brew install zola
```

for other OS, follow the tutorials [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

Then you just write your content in the MD files and embed images and videos whatever way you wish!
