## About

I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at the **University of Michigan**, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I am currently working on medical image compression software that leverages generative image models, GPU-optimized code, and modern C++ for the University of Michigan School of Medicine. I am also the **sensors lead** for the [University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle (ARV)](https://www.umarv.com/).

My interests are in distributed systems, computer networks, computer vision, robotic perception (sensor fusion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)), control systems, machine learning, and statistical analysis. I have either research, industry, course work (both undergraduate and graduate level), extracurricular, or project experience in these fields. I love robots. I aspire to create software that augments the human experience and capabilties by making the best use of the skills that I have.

Previously, I was advised by Professor Jessy Grizzle and Dr. Wami Ogunbi in the University of Michigan Biped Lab where I did optimal control research for bipedal robots and audited a book that is currently used in the undergraduate robotics curriculum. Additionally, I have teaching experience as an Instructional Aide for Computational Linear Algebra, a course that focuses on linear algebra concepts and the applications of it to robotics, machine learning, and optimization. Before that, I was a data science intern at Gondwana LLC, an ecology/agricultural technology AI startup where I trained and benchmarked various convolutional neural networks for large scale fast inference of plant diseases in real life data.

I program and study cool things in math and stats in my free time, and I also love to cook/bake, draw, make stuff on blender, play tennis, ping pong, watch movies, and dine out or getting tasty treats with friends.
