## About

I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at the **University of Michigan**, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I am currently working on medical image compression software that leverages generative image models, GPU-optimized code, and modern C++ for the University of Michigan School of Medicine. I am also the **sensors lead** for the [University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle (ARV)](https://www.umarv.com/).

My interests are in distributed systems, computer networks, computer vision, robotic perception (sensor fusion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)), control systems, machine learning, and statistical analysis. I have either research, industry, course work (both undergraduate and graduate level), extracurricular, or project experience in these fields. I love robots. I aspire to create software that augments the human experience and capabilties by making the best use of the skills that I have.

I program and study cool things in math and stats in my free time, and I also love to cook/bake, draw, make stuff on blender, play tennis, ping pong, watch movies, anime, read manga, and dining out or getting tasty treats with friends.

You can contact me via email (you probably have it if I gave you my resume) or send a connection request on Linkedin if you'd like to contact me :&#41;
