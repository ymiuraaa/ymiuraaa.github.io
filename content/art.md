Currently under construction. Will mostly have blender animations/rigging/models and random doodles. Here's Toro (a.k.a. the Sony Cat) from the game Everyday Together which was released in the early 2000s. I don't know how he ended up here but I'll let him dance here for now. I'm definitely making my own model of Toro and rigging him on Blender at some point.
