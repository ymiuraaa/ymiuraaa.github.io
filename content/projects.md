(note this is a filler image for now until I deploy the bot and start using the bots with my roomates)

This is a bot that I made for the social media platform Discord, a platform that is similar to Slack but more casual and with more practical features in my personal opinion. <br>
I made this bot to game-ify the process of doing the chores to encourage my roommates to do their chores because we tend to be busy and thus postpone doing chores. <br>
Discuss with your roommates what you want the reward to be for doing their chores the most consistently. In our case, we decided that boba ðŸ§‹ would be our reward. Each user does their chores and send a picture in a dedicated channel on the discord server to receive peer approval via emoji reactions. Once the majority of the server approves, the user will earn a point. The winner will be decided monthly based on the number of points accumulated. When there is a tie for the top winners, the winner will be chosen at random within the tie. Everybody else pitches in the money for the winner's prize.<br>

# Robotics

## mARVin (autonomous robotic vehicle)

            <source src="/img/marvinrun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </a>
</div>

This is mARVin, our autonomous robotic vehicle that we've been working on in the [University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle](https://www.umarv.com/), an engineering student organization. I've worked on the integration of sensors for mARVin and used them for [SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) algorithms in ROS2. We used sensors like IMUs, wheel encoders, and LiDAR. <br>As a sensors lead, in addition to everything I've been doing, I'll be communicating with other subteam leads and getting members to meet other subteam's needs that can be achieved with background in sensors and programming. I also host meetings and mentor new members as well. <br>Lately, we've been collaborating with the navigation team to integrate SLAM algorithms so they can do path planning with the information available from sensors and computer vision. I'm also helping out some navigation team members and leads with our custom simulation software as well.


## Web Robot Simulator and Interface

<!-- Let's insert a GIF here since that'll look pretty cool-->

This is a web-based robot simulator for path planning, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, PID, and more using Three.js. It also has a feature where you can render robots by making a JSON file that is structured in a similar way to a URDF file. (It's like an XML file but for robotics that define geometries and joints of robots). I also implemented a feature that allows the software to interface with the Fetch Robot via rosbridge. I want to thank Professor Chad Jenkins for fulfilling one of my goals I had since high school (to write code that works on the actual fetch robot, the first lab robot I've ever interacted with).


<div>
    <a class="imglink" href="/img/rrt-planner.mp4" target="_blank" width="100%">

        </video>
    </a>
</div>

This is an extension of the robot simulator where it does path-planning via RRT (Rapidly exploring random trees). The reason why I chose to do RRT over A* is because while A* can produce a more optimal path, it's quite computationally expensive due to how exhaustive it is, so it can be slow in large/complex/higher dimensions (e.g. in 3D vs 2D).

Stacked objects on top of each other with a Kuka LBR iiwa robot arm. I ensured force closure of 
object when picked up with the arm and precisely stacked them on top of each other. The simulation
was done on PyBullet.

<!-- Let's insert a GIF here since that'll look pretty cool-->

Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is an perception algorithm where you do pose estimation of an object in a scene given a model. It does this by minimizing the distance between the point clouds from the original model and the detected object that corresponds to the model in the scene. By fitting the model, we know the orientation (the pose) of the object. I made the visualization with Open3D. I plan on explaining the math and how I optimized the code in detail (via a certain data structure and design decision) in a blog post soon.

## Biped Robot Locomotion

I was learning locomotion with biped robots through this collection of projects. I want to thank Professor Jessy Grizzle and Dr. Wami Ogunbi for mentoring me as a research assistant. I have been working on this until Wami completed her PhD. I learned optimal control things like Model Predictive Control (MPC) as well as other mathematical concepts (e.g. Lie Algebra, Manifolds, etc.) and control concepts (e.g. feedback linearization, PID, etc.) and how they're applied to robotic control as well as a bit of reinforcement learning (more of a self-studied thing) via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients. I did this to <br>
1.&#41; Audit the "Biped Bootcamp" a paper by Dr. Wami Ogunbi, a paper now incorporated into the University of Michiganâ€™s Robotics Department curriculum for undergraduate instruction<br>
2.&#41; Have enough background to work on some sort of reinforcement learning for bipedal robots as a side project<br>
3.&#41; Make a robust algorithm for the robot to walk on non-stationary or inclined surfaces. Here's the simulation of the robot walking on inclines and stairs:

        <img src="/img/jtracer.png" width="100%">

I built an instagram application using client-side dynamic pages and a REST API. I also wrote a client application in JavaScript that runs in the browser and makes AJAX calls to the REST API. I briefly hosted this via AWS EC2 until my free trial expired.



## Search Engine

        <img src="/img/santorini_dithered.png" width="100%">

</div>

A simplified search engine I made. It utilizes a tf-idf based search algorithm and leverages a custom version of the MapReduce framework. The framework supports fault tolerance, and it is able to handle failures of both mappers and reducers. The framework is concurrent and can run multiple jobs at the same time. I also briefly hosted this via AWS EC2 until my free trial expired.


## A* visualizer

This is a visualization of the A* search algorithm. The heuristic I used is based on the euclidian distance from the goal coordinate. It's just a simple 2D map, so A* works for this purpose. 
I think I'll eventually make it so you can select various algorithms (DFS, BFS, Djikstra, RRT, D*, etc.)
But this is one thing I used to brush up on my data structures and algorithms skills.

# Computer Graphics, Animation, Simulations

basically anything that's relevant to graphics and simulations. That includes anything where
I use numerical analysis concepts too.

## PID simulator

I made a simple pendulum simulator using various type of numerical analysis algorithms including Euler, Verlet, Velocity Verlet, and Rungeâ€“Kutta (4th-Order).

    </a>
</div>

I also made one that works for a double pendulum too.




## Linear Complementarity Problem Simulation

I simulated collision and bouncing of a box by rewriting the constraints and the dynamics for contact resolution as a [linear complementarity problem (LCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complementarity_problem). <br>
I know the Bullet and NVIDIA PhysX physics engines uses LCP whereas the NVIDIA Isaac Sim uses some sort of penalty based approach to the problem. By changing the coefficient of restitude, you can adjust the bounciness of the box. <br>
I can also explain the math that makes this work if enough people request it.

## FSM dancing: from Three.js to Blender

Remember the web-robot simulator thing I worked on? Well the animations are done with Three.js.<br>
The background in moving simulated robots via Three.js allowed me to quickly learn how to animate things like a Finite-State-Machine. It started off with something like this:
<div>
<!-- TODO: add the stick bug animation -->
<div>

Using the background knowledge I needed to make this animation in Three.js, I was to quickly learn how to animate things like a Finite-State-Machine on Blender using Blender's logic states. So I created a dance video for a vocaloid song called Mesmerizer by Satsuki. he models are the based on the same characters from the [original MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19y8YTbvri8) taken from HatsuneDKaname on DevianArt. Since the movements are snappy, it is easy to define well-defined set points to do inverse kinematics with to the next set point. Thus, I was able to learn and create this animation despite having limited experience in Blender at the time. It inspired me to work on a blender addon too.


## In progress: a blender addon




So I want to make an addon that allows scripting the FSM in a more simpler way than the logic staes in Blender (or at least something more intuitive for programmers). I'm also going to implement another feature that could

## Data Analytics / Non-Deep Learning ML projects

# coming soon

I'll be putting in more notable data analytics projects both serious and somewhat non-serious (as long as it's done rigorously)
