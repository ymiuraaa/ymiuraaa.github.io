    Impossible List
</h1>
<small>2024-07-26 (Last updated )</small>
<p>This is my attempt to live forever or die trying, by doing what I want to do with my life. Do the things I want to do, see the places I want to see, meet the people I want to meet, and live the life I want to live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do
the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard;
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies
and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one
we are unwilling to postpone... And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's
blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which
man has ever embarked.<br> — John F. Kennedy</p>

<p>The impossible list traces its origins to its creator,
<a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">Joel Runyon</a>. It's essentially an
aspirational catalog of personal challenges, goals, and experiences that push
the boundaries of what an individual believes they can achieve.</p>
<p>The impossible list is not a bucket list, but very is similar to one. The bucket
list has this stigma attached to it which is that if the creator of it does not
complete it, they have "failed" themselves. I would have this dynamic long-term roadmap for myself, that
changes and evolves along with me.</p>
<p>I will attempt to update this list regularly, in the case where I complete
something, when I beat my friends in for something they're good at, or have something to add, with the later being most likely.</p>
