<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at the <strong>University of Michigan</strong>, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I am currently working on medical image compression software that leverages generative image models, GPU-optimized code, and modern C++ for the University of Michigan School of Medicine. I am also the <strong>sensors lead</strong> for the <a href="https://www.umarv.com/">University of Michigan Autonomous Robotic Vehicle (ARV)</a>.</p>
<p>My interests are in distributed systems, computer vision, robotic perception (sensor fusion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)), control systems, machine learning, and statistical analysis. I have either research, industry, course work (both undergraduate and graduate level), extracurricular, or project experience in these fields. I love robots. I aspire to create software that augments the human experience and capabilties by making the best use of the skills that I have.</p>
<p>I program and study cool things in math and stats in my free time, and I also love to cook/bake, draw, make stuff on blender, play tennis, ping pong, watch movies, anime, read manga, and dining out or getting tasty treats with friends.</p>
<p>You can contact me via email (you probably have it if I gave you my resume) or send a connection request on Linkedin if you'd like to contact me :)</p>
